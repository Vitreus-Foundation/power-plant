//!
//! # Module Overview
//!
//! This module defines the weight functions for the `pallet_template` in a Substrate-based blockchain.
//! Weights are used to estimate the computational resources required for specific extrinsics and ensure
//! that transactions are appropriately priced based on the computational load they impose on the network.
//! These weights are auto-generated using the Substrate benchmarking tool, which measures the resource
//! usage under controlled conditions.
//!
//! # Key Features and Components
//!
//! - **Weight Calculation for Extrinsics**:
//!   - `request_funds() -> Weight`: This function provides the weight for the `request_funds` extrinsic.
//!     The weight is currently set to `Weight::zero()`, indicating that no additional computational cost
//!     has been assigned to this extrinsic. This is typical during initial setup but should be updated
//!     based on actual benchmarking data.
//!
//! - **Auto-Generated Benchmarking Data**:
//!   - This file is autogenerated using the Substrate Benchmark CLI (`benchmark pallet`). The benchmarking
//!     process runs the extrinsic multiple times under controlled conditions to determine its resource
//!     requirements. The generated weights help to ensure that the blockchain maintains efficient performance
//!     even as usage scales.
//!
//! - **Hardware and Execution Context**:
//!   - The weights in this module are based on benchmarking performed using specific hardware configurations.
//!     Details such as the execution type (`Wasm`), database cache size (`1024`), and the environment
//!     (`Compiled Wasm Execution`) are included to help replicate the benchmarking process in similar conditions.
//!
//! - **Weight Implementation for Compatibility**:
//!   - **SubstrateWeight Struct**: The struct `SubstrateWeight<T>` provides weight information for the pallet
//!     using the Substrate node's recommended hardware. The `request_funds` function within this struct currently
//!     returns `Weight::zero()`, but it can be updated to reflect actual measurements as needed.
//!   - **Backwards Compatibility**: To ensure compatibility with older code, an additional implementation of
//!     `WeightInfo` for the unit type `()` is provided, which also returns `Weight::zero()`.
//!
//! # Access Control and Security
//!
//! - **Fair Transaction Pricing**: The weight functions defined here are used to set the transaction fees
//!   for each extrinsic. By accurately estimating the resource usage, the blockchain can ensure that users
//!   are charged appropriately for their transactions, preventing abuse and helping to maintain network
//!   stability.
//! - **Benchmarking Process**: Weights are determined through a benchmarking process that runs the pallet's
//!   extrinsics multiple times to measure their computational and storage costs. This ensures that the network
//!   remains secure by accounting for the actual load imposed by different operations, minimizing the risk of
//!   denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.
//!
//! # Developer Notes
//!
//! - **Updating Weights Based on Benchmarking**: The weight for `request_funds()` is initially set to zero,
//!   which means it imposes no fee based on computational weight. Developers should update this weight based
//!   on actual benchmark results to ensure that the extrinsic is priced according to its resource usage.
//! - **Benchmarking Environment Replication**: To replicate the benchmarking process, developers should ensure
//!   that they use a similar hardware and software environment as described in the autogenerated file comments.
//!   This helps achieve consistent and reliable benchmarking results that accurately reflect the runtime environment.
//! - **Rust Attributes for Compatibility**: The module uses specific Rust attributes (`cfg_attr`, `allow`) to
//!   handle formatting and avoid warnings about unused imports or parentheses. These attributes help maintain
//!   compatibility and cleanliness of the autogenerated code without manual intervention.
//!
//! # Usage Scenarios
//!
//! - **Setting Weights for Production Networks**: Before deploying the `pallet_template` in a production environment,
//!   it is essential to run the benchmarking process and update the weight functions accordingly. This ensures
//!   that the transaction fees are accurately set, which is critical for maintaining a balanced and fair network economy.
//! - **Testing and Development**: During testing and development, weights may initially be set to zero to simplify
//!   testing scenarios. However, as the pallet moves towards production, weights should be updated to reflect
//!   real-world performance characteristics.
//! - **Ensuring Economic Balance**: By setting appropriate weights, the blockchain can ensure that more complex
//!   transactions that consume more computational resources are priced higher, discouraging misuse and promoting
//!   fair resource allocation among network participants.
//!
//! # Integration Considerations
//!
//! - **Weight Calculation Accuracy**: Accurate weight calculation is critical to ensure that each transaction is
//!   fairly priced according to the resources it consumes. Developers should run benchmarking frequently, especially
//!   after making changes to the pallet, to ensure that weights are always up-to-date and reflect the current implementation.
//! - **Performance Impact**: Weights impact the cost of transactions on the network, which can influence user behavior.
//!   If weights are too high, users may be discouraged from using the extrinsics, while weights that are too low may
//!   encourage misuse. Regular benchmarking helps strike the right balance.
//! - **Hardware Considerations**: The weights in this module are based on specific hardware settings, as indicated in
//!   the autogenerated comments. It is important to consider the target hardware when setting weights to avoid
//!   overestimating or underestimating the computational requirements on different devices.
//!
//! # Example Scenario
//!
//! Suppose the blockchain governance decides to enable a faucet functionality through the `pallet_template` to allow
//! users to request funds for testing purposes. To determine the appropriate fee for the `request_funds` extrinsic,
//! developers use the benchmarking tool to measure the computational load under the recommended hardware configuration.
//! After running the benchmark, the weight function `request_funds()` is updated to reflect the actual resources used.
//! This ensures that users requesting funds are charged a fee that aligns with the cost of processing their requests,
//! maintaining economic fairness and preventing misuse of the faucet.
//!
