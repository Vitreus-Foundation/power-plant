//!
//! # Module Overview
//!
//! This module provides unit tests for the faucet pallet in a Substrate-based blockchain. The tests
//! are designed to verify key functionalities of the faucet, such as ensuring that users can request
//! funds within limits, enforcing the maximum allowed amount per request, and respecting the
//! accumulation period that limits fund requests over time. These tests help validate that the faucet
//! behaves correctly under different scenarios, preventing abuse while allowing fair use in a test
//! network environment.
//!
//! # Key Test Cases
//!
//! - **Basic Fund Request**:
//!   - `can_receive_funds()`: Verifies that a user can successfully request funds from the faucet
//!     within the allowed limits. The test checks that the requested amount is added to the user's
//!     free balance, ensuring the basic functionality of the faucet works as intended.
//!
//! - **Maximum Request Amount Enforcement**:
//!   - `cannot_request_more_than_max_amount()`: Ensures that a user cannot request more than the
//!     maximum allowed amount (`MaxAmount`). If a request exceeds the configured maximum, the test
//!     verifies that the pallet returns an `AmountTooHigh` error, preventing unauthorized large
//!     fund requests.
//!
//! - **Accumulation Period Enforcement**:
//!   - `cannot_exceed_max_amount_during_period()`: Tests the accumulation period logic, which restricts
//!     how much a user can request within a 24-hour period. The test simulates multiple fund requests
//!     from the same user over time, ensuring that the `RequestLimitExceeded` error is returned if
//!     the user tries to exceed the maximum limit within the specified period. It also verifies that
//!     once the accumulation period resets, the user can request funds again.
//!
//! # Access Control and Security
//!
//! - **Preventing Excessive Fund Requests**: The tests verify that users are not allowed to request
//!   more than the configured `MaxAmount` in a single request, helping prevent abuse of the faucet.
//!   Additionally, the accumulation period logic ensures that users cannot continually request funds
//!   without limits, enforcing responsible use of the faucet.
//! - **Controlled Test Environment**: The tests run within a controlled mock environment (`new_test_ext()`),
//!   which resets the blockchain state for each test. This ensures consistency and prevents tests
//!   from interfering with one another, providing reliable and reproducible results.
//!
//! # Developer Notes
//!
//! - **Accumulation Period Testing**: The `cannot_exceed_max_amount_during_period()` test makes extensive
//!   use of the `System::set_block_number()` function to simulate the passing of time. This allows
//!   developers to verify that the accumulation period is enforced correctly, preventing users from
//!   exceeding their daily limits.
//! - **Error Handling Verification**: The tests use `assert_noop!()` to verify that errors are correctly
//!   returned when invalid actions are attempted, such as requesting more than the allowed amount or
//!   exceeding the accumulation limit. This ensures that the faucet's error handling logic is working
//!   as expected and provides clear feedback for invalid operations.
//! - **Use of Assertions**: The tests use `assert_ok!()` to confirm that valid actions are executed
//!   successfully, and that balances are updated accordingly. This provides confidence that the faucet
//!   operates correctly under normal conditions.
//!
//! # Usage Scenarios
//!
//! - **Basic Functionality Testing**: The `can_receive_funds()` test ensures that the core functionality
//!   of the faucet—providing funds to users—works as expected. This is fundamental for verifying that
//!   users can request and receive tokens without issues.
//! - **Boundary Testing for Limits**: The `cannot_request_more_than_max_amount()` and `cannot_exceed_max_amount_during_period()`
//!   tests provide boundary testing to ensure that the configured limits (`MaxAmount` and `AccumulationPeriod`)
//!   are enforced correctly. These tests are crucial for ensuring that the faucet's limits prevent abuse
//!   while allowing fair usage.
//! - **Simulation of Time-Dependent Behavior**: The use of `System::set_block_number()` allows the tests
//!   to simulate the passing of time, which is critical for testing the accumulation period. This provides
//!   a way to verify that users can request funds again after the accumulation period ends, maintaining
//!   the faucet's intended behavior over time.
//!
//! # Integration Considerations
//!
//! - **Testing with Different Parameters**: Developers integrating the faucet pallet should consider
//!   running these tests with different configurations for `MaxAmount` and `AccumulationPeriod` to ensure
//!   that the faucet behaves correctly under different network conditions. Adjusting these parameters
//!   can help verify that the faucet is resilient and effective under various usage patterns.
//! - **Error Message Validation**: The error messages (`AmountTooHigh`, `RequestLimitExceeded`) returned
//!   during tests provide important feedback about the state of the faucet. Proper integration should
//!   ensure that these errors are correctly handled and conveyed to users, providing transparency in
//!   faucet operations.
//! - **Consistency and Repeatability**: The mock environment (`new_test_ext()`) ensures that each test
//!   starts with a consistent blockchain state. This is important for developers to achieve repeatable
//!   results, especially when testing the faucet in different development or staging environments before
//!   moving to production.
//!
//! # Example Scenario
//!
//! Suppose a developer needs to verify that users cannot request more than the allowed maximum from the
//! faucet in a single day. The `cannot_exceed_max_amount_during_period()` test simulates multiple fund
//! requests over time and ensures that users are prevented from exceeding their daily limits. By setting
//! different block numbers to simulate the passage of time, the test verifies that users can only request
//! funds again once the accumulation period has reset, providing confidence that the faucet's rate-limiting
//! mechanism is functioning as intended.
