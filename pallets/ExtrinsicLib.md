- **Slashing**: A penalty mechanism that reduces a validatorâ€™s or cooperatorâ€™s stake for misconduct.

### Available Operations

#### Update Energy Rate
- **What it does**: Adjusts the energy rate for validators, affecting their rewards.
- **When to use it**: Use this to adjust how much energy is produced per stake unit.

- **What it does**: Updates the reputation of a validator, which affects their reward multiplier.
- **When to use it**: Use this to incentivize better performance from validators.
- **Example**: Increasing the reputation tier for a validator that has consistently contributed to energy production.
- **Important to know**: Validators with higher reputations receive more rewards for the same amount of energy produced.

#### Apply Slashing
- **What it does**: Penalizes validators or cooperators by reducing their stake.
- **When to use it**: Use this when a validator goes offline or attempts to manipulate the energy system.
- **Example**: Slashing a validator that was caught manipulating their energy production rates.
- **Important to know**: Slashing reduces the amount of tokens held by the validator or cooperator.

- **Reputation Level**: The category or rank a user falls into based on their reputation score (e.g., "Trusted", "Newbie", "Penalized").
- **Contributions**: Tasks, votes, or other actions that users perform in the network that impact their reputation score.
- **Penalties**: Negative actions or rule violations that result in a loss of reputation points.

### Available Operations

#### Assign Reputation Points
- **What it does**: Awards reputation points to users based on their contributions or activity.
- **When to use it**: Use this to reward users who have positively contributed to the network.
- **Example**: Alice gains reputation points after voting in a governance proposal.

#### Deduct Reputation Points
- **What it does**: Deducts reputation points from users who exhibit negative behavior or violate network rules.
- **When to use it**: Use this when users need to be penalized for bad behavior.
- **Example**: Bob loses reputation points after attempting to spam the network.
- **Important to know**: Low reputation scores can restrict access to certain features or roles.

#### Check Reputation Level
- **What it does**: Retrieves the current reputation level of a user based on their score.
- **When to use it**: Use this when you need to determine what privileges or roles a user has access to.
- **Example**: Alice checks her reputation level to see if she qualifies for a new governance role.
- **Important to know**: Reputation levels unlock specific privileges and are based on a userâ€™s total reputation score.

## For Non-Developers ðŸŒŸ

### What is the SimpleVesting Pallet?
The **SimpleVesting** pallet helps manage the release of tokens over time. Vesting schedules ensure that tokens are gradually unlocked according to a preset schedule, making sure users cannot access all their tokens immediately.

- **Force Vested Transfer**: A way for administrators to move vested tokens from one account to another, applying a vesting schedule.
- **Remove Vesting**: The process of terminating a vesting schedule and slashing locked tokens if required.

### Available Operations

#### Vest Tokens
- **What it does**: Unlocks tokens for an account according to its vesting schedule.
- **When to use it**: Use this when a user has tokens locked under a vesting schedule and is eligible to receive some of them.
- **Example**: Alice's tokens are gradually released each block, and she can claim the unlocked amount after the vesting schedule completes.
- **Important to know**: The unlockable amount depends on the vesting schedule and the number of blocks that have passed.

#### Force Vested Transfer
- **What it does**: Transfers tokens from one account to another and applies a vesting schedule to the recipient.
- **When to use it**: Use this to set up a vesting schedule for a recipient who is receiving vested tokens.
- **Example**: Alice (an administrator) forces a vested transfer of 1,000 tokens from Bob to Charlie, with a schedule that unlocks 100 tokens per block.
- **Important to know**: This operation is restricted to root users to prevent unauthorized actions.

#### Remove Vesting Schedule
- **What it does**: Removes the vesting schedule from a user and slashes any remaining locked tokens.
- **When to use it**: Use this when a vesting schedule needs to be forcibly removed, typically due to non-compliance or other issues.
- **Example**: Alice (an administrator) removes the vesting schedule from Bob, slashing the remaining locked tokens.
- **Important to know**: This action can permanently remove access to the locked tokens, and only root users can execute it.

## For Developers ðŸ’»

### Technical Overview
The **SimpleVesting** pallet manages the creation, execution, and removal of vesting schedules. It enables the gradual unlocking of tokens over a predefined period based on block numbers. Administrators can use the pallet to create vesting schedules for specific users, enforce token locks, and manage the release of tokens. The pallet also allows forced vesting transfers and the removal of vesting schedules if necessary.

### Integration Points
The **SimpleVesting** pallet integrates with staking, governance, and other modules that may need to enforce token locks and controlled releases. It interacts with the runtime to calculate and release tokens based on the current block number.
