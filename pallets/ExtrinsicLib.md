## For Non-Developers ðŸŒŸ

### What is an Atomic Swap?
An atomic swap allows two parties to securely exchange tokens or assets directly without needing a middleman. It's designed so that either both parties fulfill their side of the transaction, or the swap is automatically canceledâ€”thereâ€™s no risk of one party walking away with the otherâ€™s assets.

### Key Concepts
- **Swap Conditions**: The predefined criteria that must be met for the swap to complete.
- **Hashed Proof**: A cryptographic proof that is used to verify one party has met the swapâ€™s conditions.
- **Claim**: The action of completing the swap and receiving the agreed-upon assets.

### Available Operations

#### Create Swap
- **What it does**: Initiates an atomic swap between two parties.
- **When to use it**: Use this to begin a trustless exchange of assets.
- **Example**: Bob wants to swap his tokens for Aliceâ€™s tokens, so he uses this function to register the swap.
- **Important to know**: Conditions for the swap must be agreed upon by both parties.

#### Claim Swap
- **What it does**: Claims the asset from an atomic swap when the conditions are met.
- **When to use it**: Use this to complete the swap after the required proof (such as a secret or hash) is provided.
- **Example**: Alice provides the correct proof and claims Bobâ€™s tokens after the swap conditions are satisfied.
- **Important to know**: Ensure you have the necessary proof to claim the swap.

#### Cancel Swap
- **What it does**: Cancels an ongoing atomic swap before it is completed.
- **When to use it**: Use this if the swap cannot proceed, or if one party decides to back out before completing the transaction.
- **Example**: Bob starts a swap but decides to back out, so he cancels the swap.
- **Important to know**: Once canceled, the swap is void, and assets remain with their original owners.
