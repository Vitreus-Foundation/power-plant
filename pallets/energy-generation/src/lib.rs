//!
//! # Module Overview
//!
//! This module implements several key functionalities for managing staking operations in a
//! Substrate-based blockchain. It includes logic for handling rebonding of stakes, proportional
//! slashing of stakers, and strategies for disabling validators that violate network rules.
//! These functionalities play a critical role in maintaining network security, ensuring fairness,
//! and enforcing network policies regarding stakers and validators.
//!
//! # Key Features and Functions
//!
//! - **Rebonding of Stakes**:
//!   - `rebond(value: StakeOf<T>) -> (Self, StakeOf<T>)`: This function allows stakers to
//!     reallocate part or all of their unlocking funds back into the active balance. It updates
//!     the ledger with the new active balance and the remaining unlocking chunks. This provides
//!     flexibility for stakers who wish to adjust their staking strategy after initiating
//!     withdrawal.
//!
//! - **Proportional Slashing**:
//!   - `slash_stake(slash_amount: StakeOf<T>, slash_era: EraIndex) -> StakeOf<T>`: Implements a
//!     proportional slashing mechanism where a specified amount of stake is deducted from the
//!     stakerâ€™s active and/or unlocking balance. Depending on the existence and timing of
//!     unlocking chunks, the function distributes the slash across both active and unlocking
//!     stakes, ensuring that slashing is as fair as possible while covering the entire
//!     penalty amount.
//!
//! - **Validator Disabling Strategy**:
//!   - `disable_limit(validators_len: usize) -> usize`: Computes the maximum number of validators
//!     that can be disabled based on the total active set and a defined disabling factor. This
//!     limit prevents too many validators from being disabled at once, ensuring network stability.
//!   - `decision(offender_stash: &T::AccountId, slash_era: EraIndex, currently_disabled: &[u32]) -> Option<u32>`:
//!     Decides whether a validator should be disabled based on various conditions, including whether
//!     the current disabling limit has been reached and whether the offence occurred in the current
//!     era. This ensures that only current and relevant violations lead to disabling actions.
//!
//! # Access Control and Security
//!
//! - **Controlled Validator Actions**: Disabling validators and slashing stakes are both sensitive
//!   actions that have significant implications for network security and staker confidence. This
//!   module implements checks to ensure these actions are taken only when justified, such as
//!   ensuring offences occurred in the current era and limiting the number of validators that can be
//!   disabled.
//! - **Proportional Slashing**: The `slash_stake` function employs a proportional mechanism to
//!   distribute the penalty across active and unlocking funds. This approach ensures fairness while
//!   minimizing unintended side effects, such as leaving stakers with an unusable "dusted" amount
//!   in their balances.
//!
//! # Developer Notes
//!
//! - **Defensive Programming**: Several functions use defensive programming techniques, such as
//!   `unwrap_or_else` with logging, to prevent unexpected states, like a zero disabling limit or
//!   invalid indices. This ensures robustness and reliability, even when the underlying data might
//!   contain inconsistencies.
//! - **Logging for Transparency**: Throughout the disabling logic, extensive logging is used to
//!   document decisions on validator disabling, including whether the offending validator is in the
//!   active set or if a limit has been reached. These logs are critical for tracing the reasons
//!   behind disabling decisions, which can be useful during governance reviews or audits.
//! - **Conditional Benchmarking**: The module includes benchmarking support functions that allow
//!   developers to test and optimize the staking and disabling mechanisms. These functions are
//!   conditionally compiled (`#[cfg(feature = "runtime-benchmarks")]`) to ensure they do not
//!   impact the production runtime.
//!
//! # Usage Scenarios
//!
//! - **Rebonding Unlocking Funds**: A staker who has previously initiated withdrawal can use the
//!   `rebond` function to move part or all of their unlocking balance back into the active stake,
//!   thereby continuing to participate in staking rewards. This allows for flexible staking
//!   management based on market conditions or changes in personal strategy.
//! - **Validator Accountability**: When a validator commits an offence, the `slash_stake` function
//!   is used to impose a penalty. This penalty can be applied to both active and unlocking stakes,
//!   depending on the availability of funds and the era in which the offence occurred. The `decision`
//!   function in the disabling strategy further ensures that misbehaving validators are appropriately
//!   disabled from the active set.
//! - **Enforcing Disabling Limits**: The `disable_limit` function prevents too many validators from
//!   being disabled at once, which could jeopardize network operations. This is especially important
//!   in cases where multiple validators are found to be violating network policies in quick
//!   succession.
//!
//! # Integration Considerations
//!
//! - **Economic Model**: The slashing and rebonding mechanisms defined in this module are integral
//!   to the blockchain's economic model. Developers must carefully consider the impact of slashing
//!   and rebonding on overall token supply, staking incentives, and validator behavior. Misaligned
//!   penalties could lead to excessive validator exits or reduced participation.
//! - **Customizing Disabling Strategies**: The disabling strategy can be customized by adjusting
//!   the `DISABLING_LIMIT_FACTOR` to change how many validators can be disabled relative to the
//!   active set size. This flexibility allows different networks to enforce validator accountability
//!   according to their governance models and risk tolerance.
//! - **Logging and Monitoring**: Logs generated by disabling decisions and slashing operations should
//!   be monitored by network operators to ensure that validator penalties are being applied fairly
//!   and in accordance with network rules. Misuse or errors in these operations could undermine
//!   confidence in the staking process and lead to governance interventions.
//!
//! # Example Scenario
//!
//! Suppose a validator violates network policies and is identified during the current era. The
//! `slash_stake` function is used to penalize the validator by slashing a specified amount from both
//! their active and unlocking balances. After the penalty is applied, the disabling strategy (`decision`)
//! determines whether the validator should be removed from the active set based on the current disabling
//! limit and the era of the offence. This ensures that the validator is appropriately penalized and
//! potentially disabled if their actions pose a risk to network security and stability.
//!
