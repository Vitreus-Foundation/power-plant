//!
//! # Module Overview
//!
//! This module defines the weight functions for the `pallet-privilege` in a Substrate-based blockchain.
//! Weights are used to estimate the computational cost of extrinsics, ensuring that transactions are
//! priced appropriately based on their impact on network resources. The weight functions are based on
//! benchmarking results and include database read and write operations that are required by each function.
//!
//! # Key Features and Components
//!
//! - **Weight Functions for Core Extrinsics**:
//!   - **`become_vip_status()`**: Calculates the weight for the `become_vip_status` extrinsic, which
//!     allows a user to achieve VIP status. This weight accounts for both the computational cost and
//!     database operations involved, including 3 reads and 3 writes to the blockchain state.
//!   - **`set_quarter_revenue()`**: Provides the weight for setting the quarterly revenue for VIP
//!     members. This function is essential for managing membership data and ensuring accurate revenue
//!     distribution among members.
//!   - **`exit_vip()`**: Calculates the weight for the `exit_vip` extrinsic, which allows a user to
//!     exit VIP status. The weight includes the cost of reading and modifying the blockchain state,
//!     ensuring that all membership data is updated accordingly.
//!   - **`change_penalty_type()`**: Defines the weight for changing the penalty type associated with
//!     a VIP member. This function includes multiple database reads and writes to ensure that the
//!     new penalty type is correctly recorded.
//!
//! - **Weight Implementation Structures**:
//!   - **`SubstrateWeight<T>`**: Implements the `WeightInfo` trait for a generic runtime (`T`). The
//!     weight functions are calculated based on the runtime's database weight (`T::DbWeight`). This
//!     allows the weights to be adaptable based on the specific runtime configuration, making the
//!     module suitable for different blockchain environments.
//!   - **Backwards Compatibility Implementation**: To ensure compatibility with different configurations,
//!     an implementation of `WeightInfo` for `()` is provided. This uses the default `RocksDbWeight`
//!     for database operations, which represents a standard weight used in Substrate nodes.
//!
//! - **Weight Calculation Components**:
//!   - **`Weight::from_parts()`**: Used to define the weight value, which includes both computational
//!     units and proof size. The weights are calculated based on actual measurements obtained through
//!     benchmarking, providing an accurate representation of the resource costs associated with each
//!     extrinsic.
//!   - **Database Read and Write Operations**: Each function includes `.reads()` and `.writes()` to
//!     specify the number of database operations required. These operations are crucial for ensuring
//!     that more resource-intensive transactions are appropriately priced, thereby maintaining network
//!     performance and security.
//!
//! # Access Control and Security
//!
//! - **Preventing Resource Abuse**: By assigning appropriate weights to each extrinsic, the network
//!   can prevent abuse of high-cost operations. Users are charged based on the actual resources
//!   consumed, ensuring fair use of the network and protecting against potential denial-of-service
//!   (DoS) attacks.
//! - **Accurate Resource Cost Representation**: The weights are derived from benchmarking data, which
//!   ensures that the costs are aligned with the computational and storage resources required. This
//!   accuracy is crucial for maintaining a balanced fee structure and incentivizing responsible use
//!   of blockchain features.
//!
//! # Developer Notes
//!
//! - **Benchmarking for Accurate Weights**: The weights provided are based on benchmarking results
//!   that measure the actual computational load of each extrinsic. Developers should update these
//!   weights whenever the underlying implementation changes or if the network hardware is updated.
//! - **Runtime Adaptability**: The `SubstrateWeight<T>` structure allows the weights to be adjusted
//!   based on the runtime's configuration. This flexibility ensures that the same pallet can be used
//!   across different environments while maintaining accurate weight calculations.
//! - **Simplified Testing Configuration**: The implementation for `()` uses `RocksDbWeight` for testing
//!   and development purposes. This provides a simplified configuration that retains realistic weight
//!   estimates, enabling developers to conduct tests effectively without needing a fully benchmarked
//!   setup.
//!
//! # Usage Scenarios
//!
//! - **Setting VIP Status**: The `become_vip_status()` function determines the weight for users to
//!   attain VIP status. This ensures that the cost of achieving VIP membership reflects the
//!   computational and storage resources involved, preventing excessive or frivolous requests.
//! - **Quarterly Revenue Management**: The `set_quarter_revenue()` weight function helps manage the
//!   quarterly revenue distribution among VIP members. Accurate weight calculation ensures that
//!   this important administrative task is priced correctly, reflecting its resource usage.
//! - **Exiting VIP Membership**: The `exit_vip()` function calculates the weight for users who choose
//!   to exit VIP status. This weight includes the necessary operations to update on-chain membership
//!   data, maintaining consistency in the blockchain state.
//! - **Penalty Adjustment**: The `change_penalty_type()` function allows administrators to change
//!   the penalty type for a VIP member. Proper weight calculation ensures that this action is not
//!   misused and that any adjustments are conducted fairly based on network resource costs.
//!
//! # Integration Considerations
//!
//! - **Weight Consistency Across Networks**: The weights calculated in this module are based on specific
//!   benchmarking results. When deploying this pallet to different networks, developers should ensure
//!   that the benchmarking is conducted in the target environment to maintain weight accuracy.
//! - **Performance Impact on Fees**: Weights directly influence transaction fees, which can affect
//!   user behavior. Setting accurate weights ensures a fair fee structure that prevents misuse while
//!   not discouraging legitimate usage. Regular benchmarking is advised to keep weights in line with
//!   current network conditions.
//! - **Updating Runtime Weights**: If the underlying logic of the extrinsics changes or if network
//!   hardware evolves, developers should update the benchmarking results and the corresponding weights.
//!   This helps maintain a stable and fair fee model that reflects the actual resource consumption
//!   of the pallet's functionalities.
//!
//! # Example Scenario
//!
//! Suppose a blockchain network offers VIP memberships that users can attain through a specific
//! extrinsic (`become_vip_status`). To determine the transaction fee, the weight is calculated based
//! on the computational and database operations involved. By using the `become_vip_status()` weight
//! function, the network can ensure that users are fairly charged based on the resource costs. This
//! prevents abuse while encouraging users who genuinely meet the requirements for VIP membership.
//! Similarly, administrators can manage membership data using functions like `set_quarter_revenue()`
//! and `change_penalty_type()`, with each action appropriately weighted to reflect its impact on
//! the blockchain state.
