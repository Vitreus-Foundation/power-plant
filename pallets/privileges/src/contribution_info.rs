//!
//! # Module Overview
//!
//! This module provides the core functionality for managing VIP and VIPP membership contributions
//! within a Substrate-based blockchain. It includes structures and methods for tracking VIP member
//! information, managing penalties, updating membership data, and ensuring the correctness of date
//! information used for contribution calculations.
//!
//! # Key Features and Components
//!
//! - **Current Date Information**:
//!   - **`CurrentDateInfo`**: A struct that tracks the current date, including year, month, day,
//!     quarter, and days since the start of the year. This struct is used to manage quarterly and
//!     yearly membership cycles and ensure consistency across time-based operations.
//!   - **`new()` Function**: Constructs a new `CurrentDateInfo` instance by checking the quarter
//!     and calculating the number of days since the new year. This function ensures that all date
//!     information is accurate and that the appropriate quarter is set.
//!
//! - **VIP and VIPP Membership Management**:
//!   - **`VipMemberInfo`**: A struct representing a VIP member's information, including the start
//!     date, penalty type, points, and active stake. This is used to manage membership benefits and
//!     calculate contributions.
//!   - **`VippMemberInfo`**: A struct representing VIPP member information, including VIP points
//!     and the active VIPP threshold. It is used for members who qualify for the Very Important
//!     Person Protocol (VIPP) status due to exceptional contributions.
//!
//! - **Penalty Handling**:
//!   - **`PenaltyType` Enum**: Defines two types of penaltiesâ€”`Declining` and `Flat`. The penalty
//!     calculation is based on the current quarter, and the `penalty_percent()` method provides
//!     the correct percentage based on the penalty type and current quarter.
//!
//! - **OnVippStatusHandler Implementation**:
//!   - The module implements `OnVippStatusHandler` for minting and burning VIPP NFTs. This interface
//!     defines how to handle VIPP statuses, ensuring that users who meet or lose their VIPP
//!     qualifications are rewarded or penalized appropriately by minting or burning VIPP NFTs.
//!
//! # Access Control and Security
//!
//! - **Error Handling**: The module includes validation functions (`check_quarter`, `check_days_since_new_year`)
//!   to ensure that all date-related information is accurate. Errors are handled through the `DispatchError`
//!   type to maintain consistency and robustness in the system's state.
//! - **Controlled Membership Updates**: VIP and VIPP membership updates are tightly controlled by
//!   restricting minting and burning actions to specific handlers, ensuring that only authorized
//!   operations affect member statuses.
//!
//! # Developer Notes
//!
//! - **Quarter and Year Calculation**: The `CurrentDateInfo` struct and related functions help manage
//!   the complexity of calculating the current quarter and number of days since the start of the year.
//!   These functions should be reviewed whenever changing the logic that affects how contributions
//!   and penalties are applied to members based on date information.
//! - **Penalty Type Flexibility**: The `PenaltyType` enum provides a flexible mechanism for defining
//!   different types of penalties. Developers can extend this enum to add new penalty types if needed
//!   to support additional membership rules or custom behaviors.
//! - **Handling VIPP Thresholds**: The `VippMemberInfo` struct includes an `active_vipp_threshold`
//!   field, which allows developers to track the specific items and their associated thresholds that
//!   qualify a member for VIPP status. This is essential for determining who is eligible for VIPP
//!   benefits based on their contributions.
//!
//! # Usage Scenarios
//!
//! - **Adding and Updating Date Information**: The `new()` function in `CurrentDateInfo` is used
//!   whenever new membership data needs to be updated based on the current date. It ensures that
//!   the appropriate quarter and day information is always accurate, which is crucial for calculating
//!   contributions and applying penalties or rewards.
//! - **Penalty Application**: The `PenaltyType` enum's `penalty_percent()` function is used to apply
//!   penalties based on the current quarter. This feature helps enforce different penalty schemes,
//!   such as declining penalties over time or a flat rate, depending on the network's rules for
//!   membership maintenance.
//! - **Minting and Burning VIPP NFTs**: The `OnVippStatusHandler` implementation allows for the
//!   automatic minting or burning of VIPP NFTs based on member actions. For example, when a user
//!   reaches a new threshold, the `mint_vipp()` function is called to issue a new VIPP NFT, rewarding
//!   them for their contributions.
//!
//! # Integration Considerations
//!
//! - **Integration with Energy Generation and NAC Pallets**: This module is designed to work with
//!   `pallet_energy_generation` and `pallet_nac_managing`. Developers should ensure that any changes
//!   to these pallets, particularly those affecting stake calculations or NAC level management, are
//!   reflected in this module to maintain consistency in VIP membership data and contributions.
//! - **Date Validation and Synchronization**: Since this pallet uses time-based calculations, it is
//!   critical to synchronize date-related operations with other parts of the blockchain that might
//!   rely on similar timeframes, such as staking or rewards payouts.
//! - **Extending Penalty Types**: The `PenaltyType` enum and its associated calculation logic are
//!   flexible but should be updated cautiously. If new penalty types are added, make sure that the
//!   calculation logic and associated tests are updated to reflect the changes accurately.
//!
//! # Example Scenario
//!
//! Suppose a member qualifies for VIPP status by meeting specific contribution requirements. Using
//! the `mint_vipp()` function defined in the `OnVippStatusHandler` implementation, a new VIPP NFT
//! is minted for that member, representing their status upgrade. The `CurrentDateInfo` struct ensures
//! that the correct quarter and date information is recorded, providing an accurate snapshot of when
//! the member achieved VIPP status. The `PenaltyType` is then used to determine any applicable penalties
//! for maintaining their status, depending on the member's current activity level and contribution history.
